# Using the `sqlite3` Module and Deleting Multiple Rows

***

## Instructions
Uh-oh! You tried to add a leaked track from your favorite artist's unreleased album to your database only to find that it was a trap. Now you have over a thousand copies of Milli Vanilli's "Blame It on the Rain" in your database!

Complete the function in `delete_track.py` and use it to remove all of the copies of the song in the corrupt.sqlite database.
